<h1> General Overview</h1>
<p> There's is no "top" to the World Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information</p>

By Subject
<br> Classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use. <br><br>

By Type
<br> Looking by type of service (access, protocol, etc) may allow you to find things if you know what you are looking for. <br> <br>

<p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="index.html"> About the W3 Project.</a> </p>
